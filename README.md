# reactFullGuide

learn react following https://bearit.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25595404#questions

# install node.js LTS (long term support)

# create react project `npx create-react-app react-complete-guide`

# can run `npm start` as instructed by ./react-complete-guide/README.md, to start frontend dev server.

# stop the server `ctrl + c`

# clean codes to get rid of codes not needed

# run `npm install` in ./react-complete-guide to download all dependencies according to package.json file, because the files now in ./react-complete-guide are copied from teacher who has cleaned the codes(get rid of un-needed codes)

# now rerun `npm start` to start development server

Note: should keep the development server run as long as I am developing the codes

# the ./react-complete-guide is a project about 'expense tracker'
